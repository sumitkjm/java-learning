/**
 *  Code : Is Connected ?
 * Send Feedback
 * Given an undirected graph G(V,E), check if the graph G is connected graph or not.
 * Note:
 *
 * 1. V is the number of vertices present in graph G and vertices are numbered from 0 to V-1.
 * 2. E is the number of edges present in graph G.
 *
 * Input Format :
 *
 * The first line of input contains two integers, that denote the value of V and E.
 * Each of the following E lines contains two integers, that denote that there exists an edge between vertex a and b.
 *
 * Output Format :
 *
 * The first and only line of output contains "true" if the given graph is connected or "false", otherwise.
 *
 * Constraints :
 *
 * 0 <= V <= 1000
 * 0 <= E <= (V * (V - 1)) / 2
 * 0 <= a <= V - 1
 * 0 <= b <= V - 1
 * Time Limit: 1 second
 *
 * Sample Input 1:
 *
 * 4 4
 * 0 1
 * 0 3
 * 1 2
 * 2 3
 *
 * Sample Output 1:
 *
 * true
 *
 * Sample Input 2:
 *
 * 4 3
 * 0 1
 * 1 3
 * 0 3
 *
 * Sample Output 2:
 *
 * false
 *
 * Sample Output 2 Explanation
 *
 * The graph is not connected, even though vertices 0,1 and 3 are connected to each other but there isnâ€™t any path from vertices 0,1,3 to vertex 2.
